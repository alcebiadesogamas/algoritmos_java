A repository to store my algorithms implementations in java.

## BubbleSort.java

In this file, there are two approaches to solve the sorting problem. The first one uses two for loops, where 
the number of elements visited is decreased by one in each loop. 
The second one employs a flag strategy to verify if a swap has occurred and sets flags to true until no more swaps are needed.

## QuickSort.java

In this file, only one approach is present, utilizing recursion to solve the sorting problem.
